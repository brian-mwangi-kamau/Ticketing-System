**A Ticketing System**

A *Ticketing system* or *software*, falling under ***Enterprise Resource Planning(ERP)***, is a software-based solution that helps organizations manage and track various types of requests or issues raised by their product(s)' users. It is commonly used in customer support, IT help desks, and other service-oriented environments. When a user encounters a problem or needs assistance, they create a "ticket" by providing details about the issue. The ticketing system then organizes, prioritizes, and assigns these tickets to the appropriate individuals or teams responsible for resolution. This approach ensures that requests are efficiently addressed, tracked, and documented, facilitating effective communication and problem resolution within an organization.
